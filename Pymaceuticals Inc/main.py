# (I thought we talked about this before) st.pearsonr - Pearson correlation coefficient measures the linear relationship
# between two datasets. Strictly speaking, Pearson's correlation requires
# that each dataset be normally distributed. Like other correlation
# coefficients, this one varies between -1 and +1 with 0 implying no
# correlation. Correlations of -1 or +1 imply an exact linear
# relationship. Positive correlations imply that as x increases, so does
# y. Negative correlations imply that as x increases, y decreases
